	<h1> What is Meant by LINQ </h1>
	<br>
	<p title="LINQ Def">
LinQ is a <b>'Language Integrated Query.'</b>
 LINQ provides the new way to manipulate the data, whether it is to or from the database or with an XML file or with a simple list of dynamic data.
 LINQ is a uniform query system in C# to retrieve the data from different sources of data and formats. 
It is integrated with C# to eliminate the mismatch between programming language and database.
 It provides single query interfaces for the different sources of data.
<br>
<br>
We can use <b>LINQ queries in two ways:</b>
<ul>
<li>Query Syntax</li>
<li>Method Syntax</li>
</ul>
Many times we use a combination of both. Now, with the evolution of the entity framework, the importance of LINQ has grown much higher as compared to old times.
<br>
<br>
<b>LINQ Objects</b>
<br>
<br>

As we mentioned in the above diagram, we have different types of LINQ Objects available in C# and VB.NET.
<ul>
<li>LINQ To Objects</li>
<li>LINQ To DataSets</li>
<li>LINQ To SQL</li>
<li>LINQ to XML</li>
<li>LINQ To Entities</li>
</ul>
